# GeoLocational-Arb

This project was meant to serve as a reference to people or companies that may be wanting to relocate and geo locational arbitrage. For example your company is located in Medellin, Columbia however you focus your clientele base in large US metropolitan areas therefore being able to be paid at higher rates while also conserving more capital on operating expenses due to the lower costs compared to living and working in a larger city.

In the age of the internet the place where you work and the place where you live donâ€™t have to be the same place anymore like it has been in the past now we are able to distance ourselves from the cities or even the countries where we work in. Therefore, putting time into calculating what places would be most optimal on both ends of the spectrum is crucial.
